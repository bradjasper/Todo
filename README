Simple bash script that sends an e-mail with whatever arguments you pass.

This is a quick way to fire off todo items into your e-mail inbox.

Pass an optional (-r) switch to add a reminder (currently 2 days via followup.cc)

```bash
bash>todo Pick up dry cleaning
Added todo 'Pick up dry cleaning'

bash>todo Clean car
Added todo 'Clean car'

bash>todo -r Get birthday present
Added todo 'Get birthday present' with reminder
```
